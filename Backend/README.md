### Swagger UI

After running the application, you can visit the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

This allows you to validate your API code, test functionality, and more!

Authorization is simple, just put the credentials into the "login" endpoint and a header will be in the response if successfull, copy the "Bearer ...." and paste it into the authorization field at the top of Swagger UI
