This is the code from a tutorial I was following regarding making the backend to keep track of students: their name, major, and ID. I broke the code up into the following categories: controller, doa, entity, and service. Testing the code can be done using some sort of HTTP request service. The experiment is scalable and I add a few functions to do some basic operations. Some of the operations included removing a student or updating a student.
